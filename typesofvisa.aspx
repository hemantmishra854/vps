                <p>Each country typically has a multitude of categories of visas with various names. The most common types and names of visas include:</p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    For passing through the country of issue to a destination outside that country. Validity of transit visas are usually limited by short terms such as 
                several hours to ten days depending on the size of the country or the circumstances of a particular transit itinerary

                <p style="margin: 10px;">Visas valid for longer but still finite stays:</p>
                <ul style="font-size: 18px">
                    <li>Student visa (F-1 in the U.S.), which allows its holder to study at an institution of higher learning in the issuing country. The F-2 visa allows the student's 

dependents to accompany them in the U.S.

                    <li>Research visa, for students doing fieldwork in the host country.
                    </li>
                    <li>Temporary worker visa, for approved employment in the host country. These are generally more difficult to obtain but valid for longer periods of time than a business 

visa. Examples of these are the United States' H-1B and L-1 visas. Depending on a particular country, the status of temporary worker may or may not evolve into the 

status of permanent resident or to naturalization.
                    </li>
                    <li>Journalist visa, which some countries require of people in that occupation when traveling for their respective news organizations. Countries which insist on this 

include Cuba, China, Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, the United States (I-visa) and Zimbabwe.

                    </li>
                    <li>Residence visa, granted to people obtaining long-term residence in the host country. In some countries, such as New Zealand, long-term residence is a necessary step to 

obtain the status of a permanent resident.

                    </li>
                </ul>
