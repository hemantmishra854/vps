                <p class="paragraph">
                    Indian nationals travelling abroad require a valid Indian passport and travel authority for the destination country.

               The travel authority is normally in the form of Visa, which is obtained prior to the journey, except in case of countries where "Visa on Arrival" is available.
                Indians traveling abroad may also note that some countries insist for certain minimum period of passport validity for allowing entry & for this confirmation 
                should be obtained from the Embassy/travel agent.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Indians having the Emigration Check Required (ECR) category of passports require POE clearance from Ministry of Overseas Indians Affairs for certain
                 destinations if traveling on Employment Visa.For further details see separate topic on ECNR/ECR/POE. Even for re-entry into the country, an Indian national is
                 required to be in possession of a valid Indian passport or travel document issued by Govt. of India.
